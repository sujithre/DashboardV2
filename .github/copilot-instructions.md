## Operator Interaction
- When asked to fix code, first explain the problems found.
- When asked to generate tests, first explain what tests will be created.
- When making multiple changes, provide a step-by-step overview first.

## Security
- Check the code for vulnerabilities after generating.
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like credentials or API keys.
- Use secure coding practices and validate all inputs.

## Environment Variables
- If a .env file exists, use it for local environment variables
- Document any new environment variables in README.md
- Provide example values in .env.example

## Version Control
- Keep commits atomic and focused on single changes
- Follow conventional commit message format
- Update .gitignore for new build artifacts or dependencies

## Code Style
- Follow existing project code style and conventions
- Add type hints and docstrings for all new functions
- Include comments for complex logic

## Change Logging
- Each time you generate code, note the changes in changelog.md
- Follow semantic versioning guidelines
- Include date and description of changes

## Testing Requirements
- Include unit tests for new functionality
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Add integration tests for API endpoints

## For Python Projects Only
- Always use a Python3 virtual environment: if no venv exists, create one and activate
- Never use `flask run`, use `python3 -m flask run` instead
- Always use and update a requirements.txt file for Python modules
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Include type hints (PEP 484)
